# Tools
- Splunk Enterprise
- dirsearch

# Solution
- A Link to a virtual machine hosting a splunk SIEM was provided and on getting to the interface i was provided with a serch bar to begining my investigation into the malicious activity <br />
- I searched for ssh service and made use of [All time] as our time range, we get the first answer from the src_ip field = **19**.

- I was able to get the ip address with the most connections from the same field as the firewall action is gotten by checking the action field which is blocked.

- To get the country of the ip with the most connections, we use an VirusTotal service and we get finland as our answer.
